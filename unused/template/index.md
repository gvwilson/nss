[%fixme "write template chapter" %]

-   Building a web UI is complex, so we split it into several lessons
    -   Only interaction is selecting which read-only page to display next
    -   Will implement login, forms, and file upload in future lessons
-   [%x server %] gave us an API for fetching data as JSON
-   This chapter turns that data into HTML pages using [Jinja][jinja]
-   And introduces a bit of CSS for styling
