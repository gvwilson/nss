title: "Data Sets"
---

These data generators model genomic analysis of snails in the Pacific Northwest
that are growing to unusual size as a result of exposure to pollution.

-   One or more *surveys* are conducted at one or more *sites*.
-   Each survey collects *genomes* and *sizes* of snails.
-   A *grid* at each site is marked out to show the presence or absence of pollution.
-   *Laboratory staff* perform *assays* of the snails' genetic material.
-   Each assay plate has a *design* showing the material applied and *readings* showing the measured response.
-   Plates may be *invalidated* after the fact if a staff member believes it is contaminated.

## Usage

1.  Create a fresh Python environment: `mamba create -y -n snailz python=3.12`
2.  Activate that environment: `mamba activate snailz`
3.  Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  View available commands: `make` or `make commands`
5.  Synthesize datasets: `make datasets`

## Database

The final database `data/lab.db` is structured as shown below.
Note that the data from `assays.json` is split between several tables.
